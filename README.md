# SynAP (Synaptics Absolute Positioning)
So for some reason I decided to write an absolute positioning driver for touchpads. Good for osu!, although it definitely needs testing and some performance improvements. Essentially, it makes your touchpad like a tablet but for poor people.

## Requirements
* .NET Framework 4.6.1 or newer
* Synaptics Touchpad
* Synaptics Pointing Device Drivers
